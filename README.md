# Project-Management-Report-Dashboard
This Power BI project tracks project performance using metrics like total cost, duration, workload, and budget consumption. It features a Gantt chart for project timelines and an S-Curve comparing baseline, forecasted, and actual costs. Managers can monitor progress, manage budgets, and ensure timely project completion with real-time insights.

The report will track project performance using various metrics like total cost, duration, workload, and budget consumption. It will provide both a detailed Gantt chart for scheduling and an S-curve for cost monitoring, allowing project managers to assess real-time progress and budget usage.

## Report Features:
Total Costs, Duration, and Workload:

Total Costs: The report will calculate the total actual cost of all projects and break it down by project and manager.
Duration in Days: The duration of each project will be displayed in days, showing both planned and actual completion times.
Workload: This metric will show the workload distribution across different managers and teams, providing insights into resource allocation.
## Gantt Chart:

The Gantt chart will visually present project timelines, showing the start and finish dates for each project.
Fields:
Project Name
Manager
Start Date
Finish Date
Duration (% duration completed)
Workload
Cost (Actual Cost, Baseline Cost, Forecasted Cost)
This allows stakeholders to monitor timelines, tasks, and completion rates.
S-Curve for Cost Monitoring:

Baseline Cost: Represents the initial planned cost for each project.
Forecasted Cost: This will project the anticipated costs based on the current progress and any changes during the project.
Actual Cost: The actual expenses incurred as of the current date.
The S-curve will visually show the comparison between the Baseline Cost, Forecasted Cost, and Actual Cost over time. It will highlight any budget overruns and provide a real-time view of cost performance.
Budget Consumption per Manager:

This feature will provide insights into how much of the allocated budget each manager has consumed. It will help identify which managers or teams are staying within budget and which ones are at risk of overspending.
Comparison of Forecast Cost, Baseline Cost, and Actual Cost:

Using the S-curve and additional visualizations, the report will highlight discrepancies between the forecasted, baseline, and actual costs. This allows for proactive budget management and decision-making based on cost variances.
